## About Smart

Smart Automobile Co., Ltd. is a German automotive brand and division of Mercedes-Benz Group AG. The company specializes in producing microcars and subcompact vehicles, particularly known for their distinctive, compact urban vehicles.

## Generations

### First Generation (1998-2007)
The first generation Smart car, known as the Smart City Coup√© (later renamed ForTwo), was introduced in 1998. This initial model was characterized by its ultra-compact design (less than 2.5 meters in length), rear-engine configuration, and distinctive two-tone color schemes. It was designed specifically for urban environments, with easy parking and maneuverability as key features. The original Smart used a 600cc to 800cc three-cylinder engine.

### Second Generation (2007-2014)
The second generation Smart ForTwo was launched in 2007, featuring improved safety, slightly larger dimensions, and enhanced ride comfort. This generation maintained the iconic Smart styling while offering more interior space and refined driving dynamics. Engine options included improved 1.0L petrol engines and a small diesel variant. During this period, Smart also briefly introduced the ForFour, a four-door, four-seat variant developed in conjunction with Mitsubishi.

### Third Generation (2014-2019)
Debuting in 2014, the third generation Smart ForTwo was developed as a joint venture between Daimler and Renault. This model featured a wider track for improved stability, a more premium interior, and updated technology features. A new ForFour model was also reintroduced, sharing its platform with the Renault Twingo. This generation offered improved engines, including a 0.9L turbocharged three-cylinder and a 1.0L naturally aspirated option.

### Fourth Generation (2020-present)
The fourth generation marks Smart's transition to an all-electric brand. In 2019, Daimler formed a joint venture with Geely to produce Smart vehicles, with the first model of this new era being the Smart #1, an all-electric compact SUV launched in 2022. This represents a significant departure from Smart's original microcar concept, featuring a larger footprint, longer range electric powertrains, and more advanced technology. The Smart #3, a larger coupe-styled SUV, followed in 2023, continuing the brand's electric transformation.
